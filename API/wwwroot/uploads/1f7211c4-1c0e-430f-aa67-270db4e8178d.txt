In the aftermath of a violent conflict, two sisters mourn the deaths of their parents among the carnage. They are taken in by a man named Vander.
Several years later, the tough Vi and the fragile Powder have grown up as Vander's adoptive children in Zaun, the wretched undercity to the wealthy Piltover. Along with their adoptive brothers Mylo and Clagger, they sneak their way into Piltover and attempt to rob an inventor's lab. Powder accidentally drops a crystal that causes an explosion, and so the group goes on the run. They manage to evade Piltover's Enforcers, but upon their arrival in Zaun, they are held up by a group of thugs led by Deckard. In the ensuing brawl, Powder takes off with the loot, but accidentally tosses it into the water when cornered. However, she has kept the rest of the crystals in her pocket.
Later, Vander, now a barman and a community leader, scolds the children for their recklessness, knowing that the topsider Enforcers will be looking for whoever is accountable. Elsewhere in Zaun, a crime lord named Silco tests a mysterious substance called Shimmer.
The lab blown up in the previous episode turns out to belong to Jayce, a young student at the Academy, who now has to answer to the Council for the explosion. Jayce has been researching crystals in order to master magic, to the disapproval of his mentor and the Council leader, Heimerdinger. He is expelled from the Academy and loses the favor of his patrons, the Kiramanns. However, Viktor, a Zaunite research assistant, approaches him in the aftermath and offers to help him continue his research.
Meanwhile, the Enforcers continue to investigate Zaun to find the robbers. On one hand, Grayson asks Vander to give the culprits up; on the other hand, the residents of the undercity despise the Enforcers' meddling and want to rise up against them. Vander refuses either option and plans to ride out the conflict.
Vander plans to turn himself in for the robbery. However, the arrest is interrupted by Silco, whose concoction Shimmer has turned Deckard into a violent, powerful brute. Deckard brutally murders Benzo and makes off with Vander. Ekko, who witnessed the events, informs Vi. Vi takes Claggor and Mylo with her to rescue Vander, leaving Powder behind for her safety.
Up in Piltover, thanks to some interference by Councilor Mel Medarda, Viktor and Jayce make a breakthrough with their theories, and even manage to win over Heimerdinger.
Vi and her brothers find Vander in one of Silco's hideouts. Claggor and Mylo work on rescuing him while Vi fights off Silco's thugs. Though they get close, Powder, who snuck along out of a desire to be useful, thinks they are in trouble and unleashes a homemade bomb made of the crystals she had previously stolen from Jayce. Things go south — the explosion kills Claggor and Mylo and injures Vi and Sevika. In order to defeat Deckard, Vander resorts to taking Shimmer, and is killed in the ensuing fight.
Oblivious to what has just transpired and excited that her creation worked, Powder wanders back onto the scene. Furious, Vi lashes out at Powder and leaves her behind in the chaos. After realizing she has left her sister with Silco, Vi has a change of heart, but Marcus drugs her and takes her away before she can turn back. Silco takes Powder in his arms, proclaiming that they'll show everyone who doubted and betrayed them.
Several years after the previous episode, Jayce and Viktor's breakthrough with Hextech has led to much gain and progress for Piltover. The technology has revitalized its culture and turned it into an even more prosperous city. Said prosperity is about to be celebrated at Progress Day, the 200th year of its founding. Jayce had hoped to unveil a stabilized Hex Crystal called a Gemstone that could provide Hextech technology for everyone at the ceremony, but Heimerdinger talks him out of it.
Powder has now become "Jinx", Silco's dangerous but mentally unstable top enforcer, and helps him smuggle a shipment of Shimmer into Piltover. However, the shipment is interrupted by the Firelights, a renegade gang subverting Silco's authority, and goes awry. To make up for it, Jinx causes another attack and steals the Gemstone in the process.
As a result of Mel's machinations, Jayce is named to the council. His childhood friend Caitlyn, now an Enforcer, investigates the attacks. Though Marcus (now on Silco's payroll) dissuades her from looking further into Silco, Caitlyn goes behind his back to interrogate an arrested Zaunite thug, but becomes intrigued by Vi instead.
Caitlyn has Vi released from jail so the latter can escort her around Zaun in her quest to uncover more about Silco. Vi takes her to an underground brothel, where she learns from the proprietor, an old friend of Vander's, that Powder is still alive and working with Silco. Later, Vi fights Sevika in the Lanes. Though Sevika gains the advantage and injures Vi, Caitlyn interferes to save her. Because she doesn't kill Sevika, the latter informs Silco that Vi is back and looking for Jinx.
Jinx herself is hesitant to work on the Gemstone because it reminds her of her family. Silco takes her to the water where he nearly drowned to be 'reborn'.
In Piltover, Marcus plots to put the blame for the explosion on the Firelights. Mel teaches Jayce to schmooze around with the other councilors, and the two eventually consummate their attraction as Viktor's condition worsens.
Viktor and Jayce learn that the Hexcore responds to organic matter. Heimerdinger is dismayed at this development and attempts to stop the project, despite their protests that it could help several people, including Viktor himself. Jayce maneuvers Heimerdinger into retirement at the next council meeting, to the latter's heartbreak. Marcus is tasked by Jayce with preparing Piltover for an eventual conflict, as well as with preventing Vi and Caitlyn from returning to Piltover by Silco.
Caitlyn and Vi recuperate from their fight with Sevika, with Caitlyn trading her rifle for a healing potion. Silco is quick to find them, but the two manage to escape. Jinx lets out a blue flare, and Vi realizes that she is searching for her. Vi and Jinx reunite, but the moment is spoiled by Jinx's jealousy over Caitlyn and the arrival of the Firelights.
Vi is overjoyed to learn that the leader of the Firelights is Ekko, who has carved out a niche for the group in a large tree away from Silco's territory. Ekko, who believes Jinx irredeemable, wants to use the Gemstone to defeat Silco, but Caitlyn and Vi convince him to help them return it to Jayce instead.
Meanwhile, Jayce and Viktor's paths diverge. Mel convinces Jayce to develop weapons from Hextech, while Viktor visits the undercity to consult Singed about using the Hexcore to heal himself.
Ekko escorts Vi and Caitlyn to the bridge, where Marcus and several enforcers are waiting. Vi bids them farewell, saying she wants to keep looking for Jinx. But Marcus betrays Caitlyn, forcing Vi to return; this convinces a spying Jinx that Vi has thrown her lot in with Caitlyn. Jinx detonates a number of robotic insect-like bombs, killing Marcus and the enforcers and injuring Caitlyn. Ekko fights Jinx to give Vi and Caitlyn time to escape. He easily overpowers her, but is unable to deal the killing blow, giving Jinx time to detonate a grenade.
Silco finds Jinx in the aftermath of the bridge battle and realizes she managed to steal back the Gemstone. He brings her to Singed, who uses Shimmer to heal her; in the process, Jinx hallucinates Caitlyn and Vi.
Ambessa Medarda, mother to Mel, arrives in Piltover warning of an upcoming war. Viktor's experiments with the Hexcore give him the ability to run, but at the cost of the life of Sky, his assistant. Heimerdinger visits Zaun and is disheartened by the living conditions in the undercity; he meets a still-injured Ekko and the two hit it off.
Caitlyn and Vi gain an audience before the Council, but fail to convince them that Silco is a threat. Vi convinces Jayce to attack one of Silco's Shimmer factories alongside her, but Jayce becomes conflicted upon realizing he has killed a child.
Meanwhile, as Caitlyn returns home after she and Vi go their separate ways, she is confronted by a Shimmer-infused Jinx.
Jayce personally meets with Silco, offering him Zaunite independence and resources from Piltover in exchange for Jinx. He also stops Viktor from killing himself, and the two resolve to destroy the Hexcore.
Silco is conflicted about the peace treaty, acknowledging that he is on the verge of accomplishing everything he wanted, but does not want to give up his daughter. Jinx overhears it, however, and becomes convinced Silco will betray her. Vi returns to The Last Drop and has a final throwndown against Sevika, defeating her and tearing off her arm, but Jinx blindsides her in the moment of her victory and knocks her out.
Jinx ties Vi, Caitlyn, and Silco up at a dinner table and tells her sister that she can have Powder back if Caitlyn is eliminated. Both Vi and Silco appeal to Jinx, who then has a breakdown and accidentally shoots Silco. He reassures her in his last moments that he would not have given her up and that she is perfect the way she is, causing her to fully accept that she is now Jinx and that she and Vi are now too different.
Jayce appeals to the council to vote for peace with Zaun. However, just as a unanimous decision for peace is reached, Jinx fires a Gemstone-powered rocket launcher at the council building.
Piltover reels from Jinx's attack on the Council building, in which Councilors Borbok, Hoskel, and Kiramman were killed. Jayce brings an injured Viktor to the laboratory, where his body bonds with the Hexcore. After Caitlyn buries her mother, Councilor Salo (backed by Ambessa) urges a Hextech-powered invasion of Zaun. At the Kiramman estate, Caitlyn's father gifts her the family key. Caitlyn offers Vi an Enforcer badge. Vi is horrified as Enforcers killed her mother, and leaves. In private, Mel assures Jayce that she will not allow her mother to corrupt Jayce and Viktor's dream. A squad of Enforcers find Vi, who has befriended a local man.
The remaining Councilors unveil a memorial for the deceased, but Mel's speech is interrupted by an attack by Renni and a group of Zaunites in powered mechanical suits. Several civilians and Enforcers are killed, and Renni nearly kills Jayce before Vi intervenes. Ambessa's forces put a swift stop to the attack. Later, Vi tries to comfort Caitlyn. The Council wonders how so many Zaunites were able to sneak into a secure event. Caitlyn interrupts and announces that she will lead a Hextech-armed strike force into Zaun with the goals of apprehending Jinx, dismantling Shimmer, and stamping out the remnants of Silco's forces.
In the aftermath of Silco's death, Zaun has descended into chaos, with the Chembarons fighting each other for control of the Lanes. Jinx wanders the streets and saves a child who follows her. Sevika tries to put a stop to the turf wars and unite the barons against Piltover but a baron named Smeech suggests they hand over Jinx to Piltover, but Sevika declares they don't hand over their own people. She later encounters Jinx in Silco's old office and they bond over feeling lost without Silco.
Viktor awakens in a new augmented body. Jayce is delighted that he is alive, but Viktor is disgusted at his new form. Jayce states his intention to resign from the council and resume their research, but Viktor declares that their paths have diverged and leaves. Back at the Firelights' base, Ekko receives refugees from the infighting. He asks Heimerdinger to analyze a diseased leaf from the tree. Jayce catches them trying to break into his laboratory and corroborates Heimerdinger's comparison to the corruption caused by the Hexcore.
Jinx sees Caitlyn's strike team in "The Grey" and escapes, horrified by the revelation that Vi is one of them. She is accosted by Smeech and his men. Sevika, armed with a new prosthetic arm from Jinx, helps her defeat them. Viktor also returns to Zaun, seemingly guided by Sky; he encounters a group of Shimmer addicts led by Huck. Viktor cures Huck of his affliction, seemingly gaining himself some followers.
Elsewhere, Singed continues his research, which appears to involve the organs of the slain beasts.
Caitlyn learns her mother had ordered a ventilation system installed in Zaun to direct The Grey away from its residents. She decides to weaponize the Grey against Zaun as her team hunts Jinx in the Lanes. They find a man named Heenot, formerly one of Smeech's goons, strung up over a vent; Heenot reveals Jinx is planning something in the vents. In private, Vi wonders if it would be better to go after Jinx as a pair. Caitlyn promises her that she will not change and the two kiss.
Ambessa receives an audience from Amara, the Piltover noble Jayce had struck a deal with in the previous season. Amara reveals herself to have powers relating to black roses and threatens Ambessa, who quickly kills her. Ambessa worries that their situation will worsen. She confronts Salo, who is being attended to by a woman named Lest, and orders him to rally Piltover's aristocracy. Lest discusses the meeting with Mel. Later, Elora confirms that Salo met with the noble houses and that Ambessa's enemies have managed to strip her of her holdings.
Jayce explains the concept of wild runes to Ekko. The group speculates that the patterns may be a result of Arcane overuse and go underground the Hexgates to investigate as Vi and Caitlyn confront Jinx. Jinx taunts Caitlyn before she and Sevika engage the pair in combat. Meanwhile, Jayce, Ekko and Heimerdinger are confronted with a wild rune and transported to a mysterious location; as a result Vi and Caitlyn's weapons go on the fritz. Caitlyn shoots off one of Jinx's fingers as Vi is about to deliver the final blow; however, Isha intervenes and points a gun at Vi's face. Unwilling to hurt the child, Vi tries to talk Caitlyn down, giving Jinx, Sevika and Isha time to escape. Sevika sets off an explosion that blasts Piltover with aerosolized paint. Caitlyn scorns Vi for allowing Jinx to escape again.
Ambessa and Salo meet with Piltover's aristocracy. She blames Zaun for Amara's death and advises the city to declare martial law with Caitlyn at the helm. As Caitlyn accepts the position, flashbacks reveal that Ambessa also engineered Renni's attack on the memorial. Mel is seemingly kidnapped by an organization known as the Black Rose.
Singed continues his experiments; he has created what appears to be a monstrous beast.
Some time has passed since the previous episode. With the help of the Noxians, Piltover has subjugated Zaun and put it under martial law, while Mel, Jayce, Ekko and Heimerdinger are still missing. Caitlyn frets about her leadership position and the military effort while Maddie encourages her. Although a resistance of sorts has formed in Zaun by people modeling themselves after Jinx, she has gone underground, preferring to care for Isha. At a checkpoint, Rictus arrests one such rebel, while Isha impersonates Jinx with a theatrical stunt. Rictus and Ambessa interrogate the man, who reveals that Sevika is leading a Zaun rally at Vander's statue. Rictus interrupts the rally, destroys Sevika's arm, and arrests several Zaunites including Isha and Singed.
Jinx and Sevika infiltrate Stillwater and free the prisoners. Jinx is reunited with Isha just as Singed's wolf, Warwick, arrives at the prison. Warwick overpowers the Enforcers. Jinx allows Sevika and Isha to flee to confront the beast herself, but Warwick calls her "Powder" in Vander's voice.
Anguished by her time with the Enforcers, Vi has dyed her hair and begun fighting in an underground fighting ring. Jinx visits her to tell her Vander is alive and the sisters visit the tunnel where Jinx had last seen him. The sisters get into a brawl, but soften towards one another. Meanwhile, Caitlyn unsuccessfully interrogates Singed. In private, Ambessa offers Singed a place as a weaponmaker in her court. Singled is astonished that Vander's daughters could restore him to sanity. As he concocts a formula intended to locate Vander, Caitlyn presses him about his prior identity as Dr. Corrin Reveck, an unparalleled alchemist dismissed from the Academy for a crime, and his invention of Shimmer. He reveals his motivation is to cure his dying daughter.
Mel awakens in a prison. Her cellmate is her brother Kino, whom she had thought dead. Kino tells her that Ambessa has another child borne out of an affair, and this child is why the Black Rose had targeted them. She figures out that the room is a puzzle and the man in front of her is a fake. She slams his head into the wall and is once again transported into the Black Rose's prison. A voice claiming to be her sister taunts her. A glow emanates from Mel's body, seemingly destroying her chains.
Vi and Jinx find a letter from Vander to Silco. The beast eventually finds them and Vi fights him. Jinx begs her to believe the wolf is Vander and Vi sets down her gloves. A flashback shows Vander and Silco with the sisters' mother as she tells them she is pregnant with Violet and encourages them about the formation of Zaun. Vander and his daughters hug.
A ragged Jayce emerges from the wild rune to find Salo, no longer paraplegic. Viktor speaks to Jayce through Salo, imploring them to meet. Jayce, disgusted by Viktor's distribution of Hextech to the people, kills Salo.
In a mysterious void, Viktor and Sky lament Salo's death. While training Caitlyn, Ambessa receives news that Vander/Warwick is in Zaun. Vi, Jinx and Isha have taken him to Viktor's new commune in the fissures, hoping that Viktor will cure him. Viktor peers into the beast's mind and assures the sisters that he will do his best to heal him on the condition that he is restrained at night. Viktor makes progress in unearthing Vander's psyche;Vi wonders what it would be like to stay in the commune. Singed, Ambessa and Caitlyn arrive with a group of soldiers. Singed tells Viktor that Vander/Warwick's blood with stabilize and empower him, but Viktor refuses. Singed reports to Ambessa that he can craft an anti-cure for Warwick. Caitlyn brings Vi to the Noxian camp. Ambessa realizes that Vi has plotted with Caitlyn to sabotage the mission; Vi traps Ambessa while Caitlyn subdues Singed before he can deliver the potion. Rictus incapacitates Caitlyn. Jinx tries to stop him, and Vander knocks out Rictus to protect her.
Jayce enters the commune and experiences mysterious and harmful visions. He shoots Viktor with his hammer, causing all of the commune's residents to die, while Singed injects his anti-cure into Vander/Warwick to make him go mad, making him maul Rictus to death. The sight of Caitlyn with Vi and Rictus dead causes Ambessa to attack the group. To protect Jinx, Isha overloads her gun with Hextech gemstones and shoots it at Warwick.
Ekko awakens in an Alternate Timeline where Zaun is prosperous, Vander, Benzo, Claggor and Mylo are alive, and he and Powder are working on a project for the Innovators' Competition. He encounters Heimerdinger, who has been in the timeline for three years. Heimerdinger explains that the wild rune scattered them across time and in this world, Hextech was never invented, leaving them without an exit. Powder angrily "reminds" Ekko that the theft of Jayce's lab went wrong, resulting in Vi's death. Ekko returns to Jayce's abandoned lab and finds some Hexcrystal shards. He brings these to Heimerdinger and recruits Powder to help them. The group eventually develops a device called a "Z-Drive" which enables Ekko to rewind time by four seconds. Powder and Ekko attend a party, where they dance and kiss. Meanwhile, Heimerdinger gives the machine an upgrade. Heimerdinger sacrifices himself to restore Ekko back to his body and send him back to the correct timeline with the Z-Drive.
Jayce, meanwhile, awakens in a Bad Future where the Hexcore has destroyed both Piltover and Zaun and seemingly killed all its inhabitants. Surviving on scraps, he follows a hooded figure, whom he recognizes as the mage from his childhood, through the carnage. He finds the figure by his corpse and takes his counterpart's warped hammer, intending to fix things.
Mel unleashes a power that breaks the Black Rose's prison, where she meets a shapeshifting sorceress who congratulates her and reveals their plan to stop Ambessa from destroying Piltover. Mel is welcomed into the organization and given a necklace.
Meanwhile, Singed attempts to revive Warwick and Viktor. Viktor awakens and suggests using the anomaly in the Hexgates, but fears Jayce's defense. Ambessa offers to take Viktor to the anomaly if he empowers her forces. Vi wakes up to find Loris and confronts Caitlyn about Jinx’s arrest, insisting Jinx has changed. Caitlyn later visits Jinx in her cell.
Mel reunites with a distrustful Jayce in the council chamber, but they are interrupted by an automaton controlled by Viktor. After defeating it together, Jayce and Mel reconcile.
In her cell, Jinx hallucinates Silco, who urges her to escape the cycle of violence. When Vi visits, Jinx locks her in, determined to "break the cycle." Caitlyn arrives to release Vi, revealing she removed the guards deliberately. Overcome with emotion, Vi kisses Caitlyn, and they make love.
Jayce addresses representatives from Piltover and Zaun, stating that Ambessa will lead Viktor's followers against them and urging unity in the impending war. As residents flee, forces from both sides prepare for defense at the Hexgates. Mel visits Ambessa's camp to ask her mother to spare Piltover, but Ambessa reveals her resentment towards mages and unveils an army of automatons created by Viktor and Singed. Singed completes the transformation of Vander into Warwick.
Jinx, in despair, burns down Silco's headquarters and attempts to kill herself with a Hextech grenade, but Ekko intervenes, rewinding time to stop her.
The battle against the Machine Herald begins, with Jayce asking the Enforcers to hold off Ambessa’s forces while he dismantles the Hexgates. Caitlyn leads a team to disable Viktor's cocoon, but their plan is sabotaged. Mel deflects a bullet from Maddie, killing her, and tries to reason with Ambessa. Jinx, Sevika, and Ekko arrive with Zaunite forces, causing chaos and buying time to destroy the cocoon, which is found empty. Ambessa unleashes her immortal army. Vi and Jinx confront an enhanced Warwick while Caitlyn and Mel take on Ambessa. Caitlyn loses an eye, allowing Mel to summon the Black Rose, which kills Ambessa. Ekko crashes the ship into the Hexgate.
Meanwhile, a transformed Viktor tells Jayce that his "Glorious Evolution" is the best path for humanity. As they battle, Ekko uses the Z-Drive against Viktor but struggles with the creatures in his way. He risks overextending the Z-Drive to throw it at Viktor, who is shocked by its existence. Jayce shows Viktor his future self, who regrets his actions. This convinces Viktor to seek another path, and they disappear, deactivating the creatures.
Vander awakens and attacks Vi, but Jinx uses her speed to push him off a ledge. Vi catches both, but Jinx takes the gemstone, causing them to fall and seemingly activating the grenade.
In the aftermath, the cities mourn and begin to rebuild. Sevika joins the council, and Singed spends time with his daughter in her new robotic body. Mel departs for Noxus, while Caitlyn examines Hexgate schematics, pondering Jinx's survival as Vi assures her they will keep fighting together.
